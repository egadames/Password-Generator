### Description

- The app is a website that will generate a password between 8-128 characters.

- The generator has buttons for the user to decide what needs to added into the password.

- there is a prompt that ask the size of the password and does not allow it be too short or too long.

### Technologies

- The website uses HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Challenges

- This website was very interesting to make and it was something I enjoyed.

- The most difficult issue were trying to incorporate the event listeners. I was able to do to develop the logic quickly and make a 
standard version that used prompts to get the required information. The incorporating of the checkbox was difficult but with the tutor's help and reading Mozilla guides I was able to make it function correctly.

- By the end I was able to get a decent understanding of use the event listeners and how to incorporate them in the HTML and Javascript.

- My best method of learning was the the help of the tutor and trial and error. I would read on how to add features to HTML and Javascript that i wanted on the generator. I would attempt to add them but often it would not quite work propertly so with the help of the tutor it would get sorted. I repeated until the password generator was completed.
